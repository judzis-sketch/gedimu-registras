/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for the Gedimų Registras application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces role-based access control for employee data and issue management. Employees can only manage issues assigned to them, while administrators have broader access. This prioritizes security and scalability by denormalizing employee roles onto issues, ensuring authorization independence.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /issues/{issueId}: Stores issue reports. Includes a denormalized 'assignedToId' field to link issues to employees.
 * - /employees/{employeeId}: Stores employee information.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Employees can only create, update, and delete issues assigned to them.
 * - Administrators have full access to all employee and issue data.
 * - Prevents unauthorized access to employee data and ensures that issues are managed appropriately.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The `Issue` document includes the `assignedToId` field. This enables rules to authorize access based solely on data present in the document, without requiring `get()` calls to the `Employee` document.
